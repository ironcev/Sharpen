/* 
    [1] Derived class must either set the text in the constructor or override the GetText() method.
        This is a slight optimization.
        We have two different kinds of derived classes (concrete tree view items) when it comes to their Text property.
        Some of them display strings that are already available in the system (e.g. Project name).
        In other words, they do not create new strings.
        Other create new strings just for the purpose of having a nice textual representation.
        In the second case, we want to have lazy load, for which the GetText() method is provided.
        In the first case, we do not want to force the derived class object to potentially unnecessary store reference to 
        this already known string just to be able to use it in the GetText() method.
        We also want to save the virtual call to the GetText() method.
        Therefor these two options. If the textual representation is already known in the system, just pass it to the base constructor.
        If it has to be calculated, pass null to the base constructor and implement the GetText() method.
